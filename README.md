# Philosopher

## What is this?

This project is one of many 42 school projects. 

This is made to teach you using threads and understanding basic synchronization concepts.

We use mutexes here as synchronization.

## What is the assignment?

### Well, here we are discovering a classic CS problem: Dijkstra dining philosophers problem! 

The problem itself is that there are n philosophers sitting at the table.

Each one of them has only one fork.

But they want to eat spaghetti and for that they need 2 forks!

They have to eat, sleep, think (obviously) and repeat so they don't die.

## How to run

Run ```Make```

Than, run ```./philosopher Help``` and follow instructions!
